# Story Planner: "She Gets Ready and Leaves"

This project is a JavaScript-based story planner that demonstrates narrative generation using a rule-based system. It follows a series of story "operators" inspired by story grammar research (Propp, Lebowitz, Eco).

## Features

- Rule-based planning of story events
- Operators with preconditions, additions, and deletions
- Outputs a step-by-step story in the console and on the webpage
- Easily extensible for new stories

## Story Example

The story generated by this project:
BEGINNING
she sends a text message
the phone lights up with a response
she walks toward the mirror
she applies her lipstick
she grabs her purse from the hook
he rings doorbell
her heart beats
she turns door knob
they walk to the car
ENDING
